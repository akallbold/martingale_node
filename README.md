# Martingale

The Martingale betting strategy can be applied to roulette because if betting on colors, each spin only has two outcomes (win or loss) and the probability of each happening is close to 50% (assuming you are picking between red or black).

The Martingale strategy is as follows: If you win, you save your earnings and bet again with the lowest possible bet. If you lose, you double your bet. You play until you reach your goal winnings or you lose your maximum investment. While the Martingale strategy has the same expected value of winning (which is negative), it may be an attractive betting strategy to some because you are betting that you will not lose many times in a row.

The simulation works by the user inputting the amount of money they are hoping to win (goal). Then the user inputs the amount of money they are willing to lose (max investment). The minimum bet value defaults to $10 which is common in many casinos but can be changed as well.
